**Mood: 😑**

今天做了一套雅思听力，虽然大体上都能听懂，但还是有几道题没有听出来。不过我能感觉到，只要练习一段时间，提升到想要的分数是有可能的。目前最大的问题还是口语，虽然写作也不简单，但我对如何练习还有头绪，并且写作时我可以最大程度地发挥我的词汇量。而对于口语，我心里并没有自己感觉有效的提升方法。

Today, I did an IELTS listening practice test. While I could understand most of the content, there were still a few questions I missed. That said, I can feel that with consistent practice, reaching my target score is achievable. Right now, my biggest challenge is speaking. Although writing isn't easy either, I at least have a clear idea of how to improve, and I can fully utilize my vocabulary when writing. Speaking, on the other hand, is different—I haven't found a method that I truly believe will help me improve.

The temperature has slumped since last night, by almost 20 degrees. It's absurd, isn't it? Yesterday I was **sweating** to death and today I am **shivering** in the freezing draft!
