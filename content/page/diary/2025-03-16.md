**Mood: 🙃**

如果未来的我想知道现在的我是如何心情，唯一的方法便是翻翻看此时写下的东西，可能是一些聊天记录，不过更可靠的还是日记，毕竟日记就是写来给未来的自己看的。

我的心情五味陈杂，难以用只言片语概括之。有些想法过于苦恼，连写给自己都不知从何讲起。我感觉自己无时无刻不在浪费时间和金钱；我觉得自己没有投入任何事，因此也没有获得任何回报；我恨自己不能时刻努力，又想何必活得那么辛苦；我看到即使是那么懒的人都心安理得的活着，我又何苦每天自责？我讨厌思考未来，又被未来困惑；我只觉得这整个事情都是一个巨大的阴谋，可无法回到过去阻止自己。我想我应该看开些，珍惜当下，可对过去的悔恨和对未来的恐惧常常侵袭。

If my future self wants to know how I am feeling right now, the only way is to check out what I've written, maybe some messages, but a diary, written for this very purpose, is probably more reliable. 

I have very mixed feelings right now—so complex that they cannot be summed up in a few words. Some thoughts are so troubling that I even struggle to put them into words, even for myself. I feel like I am constantly wasting time and money; I feel like I am not truly committing to anything and, as a result, reaping no rewards. I resent myself for not working hard all the time, yet I also question why I should live such a harsh life. I see people lazier than me living at ease, so why do I keep blaming myself every day? I hate thinking about the future, yet I am trapped by it. It all feels like a grand conspiracy, but I can’t go back in time to stop myself. I suppose I should learn to let go and cherish the present, but regret for the past and fear of the future keep creeping in.
