今日的工作结束了。从早上到下午三点，挺累。距离我计划中的回家也不过三个多月的时间了。为了成功实现我设想的通过雅思成绩在培训机构挣钱的计划，我需要尽快准备好再次参加考试。

我想念所有的痛楚，撕心裂肺。

Today's work has done. It's exhausting working from early morning all the way until 3 p.m. It's a mere three months until my planned trip home. To successfully carry out my plan of making money at a training institution with my IELTS scores, I need to prepare well for the exam again as soon as possible. This raises a question: How?
