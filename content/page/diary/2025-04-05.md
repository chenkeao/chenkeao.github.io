Question:


Some people say History is one of the most important school subjects. Other people think that, in today's world, subjects like Science and Technology are more important than History.
Discuss both these Views and give your own opinion

answer:  (6.5 - 7)

Some people argue that history is one of the most important subjects in the school curriculum, while others think that such empirical subjects as science and technology outweigh history. In my opinion, although history can help students understand their cultures and even the world better, subjects like science and technology can offer crucial skills assisting students to be successful in their careers and live a better life, hence more important than history.

History help people understand their own cultures, conventions and perhaps religious. By learning history, people are able to understand where their conventions come from, the interesting or probably educating stories behind their cultures and the significance of their beliefs. Furthermore, as an old saying goes: there is nothing new under the sun, people can always learn from the history, maybe through mistakes made by their ancestors or glory deeds passed by generations. 

One can argue that if someone is totally ignorant about the history of their own countries or the Second World War they would be perceived to be illiterate. However, people who have no knowledge of modern science and technology cannot fit in the society. For example, in recent days, people unable to use smart phones or the internet will have trouble to keep pace with others, let alone being successful and prosperous. Moreover, since the 20th century,  scientists have been playing increasingly important roles in the world. Their inventions such as computers, new treatments of cancers are some of the pinnacles of the human achievements and has benefited the human race deeply. 

In conclusion, history has its unique importance in education but modern science and technology are essential for people to succeed in career and lead to a better life. 

### **Paragraph 1: Introduction**

> **1.** _Some people argue that history is one of the most important subjects in the school curriculum, while others think that such empirical subjects as science and technology outweigh history._

✅ **Fluency**: Smooth  
✅ **Naturality**: Mostly natural  
🎯 **Band 7.5–8?** ✅ Yes  
📝 **Comment**: Very clear and balanced. "Empirical subjects" is a good word choice. You could say “are more important than history” instead of “outweigh history” for slightly more natural tone, but this is still acceptable.

> **2.** _In my opinion, although history can help students understand their cultures and even the world better, subjects like science and technology can offer crucial skills assisting students to be successful in their careers and live a better life, hence more important than history._

✅ **Fluency**: Understandable, but a bit heavy  
🚫 **Naturality**: Slightly awkward phrasing  
🎯 **Band 7.5–8?** ❌ Needs polish

📝 **Problems**:

- “assisting students to be successful” → better: **"helping students succeed"**
- “live a better life” is vague and overused
- “hence more important than history” is abrupt

🔧 **Improved Version**:

> "Although history helps students understand their culture and the broader world, science and technology provide essential skills that enable students to succeed professionally and improve their quality of life. Therefore, they are arguably more important in today’s context."

### **Paragraph 2: Value of History**

> **3.** _History help people understand their own cultures, conventions and perhaps religious._

🚫 **Fluency**: Has a grammar issue  
🚫 **Naturality**: Sounds unnatural  
🎯 **Band 7.5–8?** ❌ No

📝 **Problems**:

- Subject-verb agreement: **"History helps"**, not "help"
- “perhaps religious” → ungrammatical, should be “perhaps religion” or better “religious beliefs”

🔧 **Improved Version**:

> "History helps people understand their culture, customs, and possibly their religious beliefs."

---

> **4.** _By learning history, people are able to understand where their conventions come from, the interesting or probably educating stories behind their cultures and the significance of their beliefs._

🚫 **Fluency**: A bit clumsy

🎯 **Band 7.5–8?** ❌ No

📝 **Problems**:

- "Probably educating" → incorrect word form and awkward

---

> **5.** _Furthermore, as an old saying goes: there is nothing new under the sun, people can always learn from the history, maybe through mistakes made by their ancestors or glory deeds passed by generations._

🚫 **Fluency**: Slightly confusing

🎯 **Band 7.5–8?** ❌ Not quite

📝 **Problems**:

- Punctuation: you need a semicolon or a full stop after “sun”
- "glory deeds" → should be "glorious deeds" or "heroic acts"

🚫 **Naturality**: “perceived to be illiterate” sounds off  
🎯 **Band 7.5–8?** ❌ Needs improvement

📝 **Problems**:

- “countries” → should be **“country”** (subject-verb agreement)
- “perceived to be illiterate” → better phrased as “considered uneducated” or “seen as lacking cultural awareness”
    

🔧 **Improved Version**:

🚫 **Fluency**: Clunky  
🚫 **Naturality**: “fit in the society” is incorrect  
🎯 **Band 7.5–8?** ❌ No

📝 **Problems**:

- “fit in the society” → should be “fit **into** society” or “function in today’s society”
    
- Lacks sophistication
    

🔧 **Improved Version**:

> "However, individuals without basic knowledge of modern science and technology may struggle to function in today’s society."

---

📝 **Problems**:

- “in recent days” → awkward. Better: "nowadays"

🔧 **Improved Version**:

**Answer: (7.5 - 8)**

Some people argue that history is one of the most important subjects in the school curriculum, while others believe that in today's world, subjects such as science and technology are more valuable. In my opinion, although history provides students with a deeper understanding of their cultural identity and the evolution of societies, science and technology equip them with practical skills essential for success in modern life. Therefore, these subjects hold greater importance in today’s context.

History allows individuals to gain insight into their cultural heritage, traditions, and religious beliefs. By studying historical events and movements, students can understand the origins of societal norms and the stories that shaped national and global identities. Moreover, as the saying goes, "There is nothing new under the sun"—many challenges faced today have historical parallels. Learning from past mistakes and achievements can guide better decisions in the present and future.

However, while cultural literacy is important, the modern world demands a strong foundation in science and technology. Without basic digital literacy, individuals may struggle to keep up with everyday tasks, let alone thrive in competitive workplaces. For instance, those unfamiliar with using smartphones or the internet can find themselves excluded from both professional and social spheres. Furthermore, scientific and technological advancements have significantly improved our quality of life—from life-saving medical treatments to innovations like computers and clean energy. These contributions demonstrate the indispensable role of these fields in shaping a better future.

In conclusion, while history offers valuable lessons and cultural awareness, science and technology are essential for navigating and succeeding in the modern world. Therefore, they should be prioritized in education systems to better prepare students for the demands of contemporary life.
