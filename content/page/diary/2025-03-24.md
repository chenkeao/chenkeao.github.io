**Mood:**

Recently I've been practicing IELTS listening, but I still find it quite challenging. That said, I can get almost all the questions right in cloze tasks, which are typically in section 1 and 4. This is pretty exciting considering I'd be pleased if I got more than 5 questions right in section 4. What else... I really hate British accent that contains inordinate amount of nasal sounds, making them sound like a dull bell! Although I cannot always understand American English, it still sounds clear and convincing. Anyway, I might as well stop complaining and practice more instead. After all, who likes a cynical loser?
