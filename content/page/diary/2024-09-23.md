Today is Monday and I right now is 2pm. I sit at the level B1 where I can get hot water and I peace of space on a share table. I really hate the laziness of my roommate who has been lying on the bed from last night to now and may continue to lay until lunchtime. Granted he doesn't have many classes and assignments, but he still just too lazy to live. He left his dishes used for last dinner greasy. He is all over the place.
How about myself? I am writing this silly journal and then I am going to watch a silly video  on canvas that was stuffed full of Australian accent and teaching Data Analytics. What's more... I may learn some English after another silly lecture at 5pm and go back home learning English. I am so full that my stomach is pretty uncomfortable. I hate pasta either.
